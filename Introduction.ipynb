    "For the term project, we are analyzing the “Ames, Iowa House Pricing Project” dataset on Kaggle. This dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It describes the sale of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. It contains data about factors that seemed to influence housing prices, 2930 observations and a large number of explanatory variables (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous) involved in assessing home values. There are approximately 81 factors to be considered that play into the final housing value. \n",
